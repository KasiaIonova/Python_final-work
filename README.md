Objectives:

Identification of key trends: Analyzing the dynamics of COVID-19 spread in various countries and regions, identifying the main factors affecting morbidity and mortality.
Evaluating the effectiveness of measures to combat the virus: Studying the impact of measures taken to combat COVID-19 (e.g., quarantine restrictions, vaccination, medical care) on the dynamics of morbidity and mortality.
Identification of risks and opportunities: Identifying the most vulnerable populations and high-risk regions, as well as potential opportunities to improve the situation.
Formulation of recommendations: Developing recommendations for government agencies, health organizations, and other stakeholders to enhance the strategy to combat COVID-19, considering the identified insights.
Monitoring and adaptation of the strategy: Conducting regular monitoring of the situation and adapting recommendations according to changes in the epidemiological situation and the effectiveness of measures taken.

Questions to study:

In which countries and on which continents have there been the most cases of Covid-19?
Where was the high mortality from Covid-19 observed?
Where were the most cases of recovery from COVID-19?
In which periods were the greatest number of cases of disease, mortality, and recovery from COVID-19 observed?
How is the incidence related to distance from the disease focus?
How did vaccination and quarantine measures (using a specific country as an example) affect the incidence of COVID-19? Compare two similar countries with different lockdown policies.

Results:

Report with key insights: Delivering a comprehensive report highlighting the primary findings of the analysis, encompassing identified trends, risk factors, the effectiveness of virus-combatting measures, and recommendations.
Presentation for stakeholders: Conducting a presentation of the analysis results for relevant stakeholders, offering a thorough explanation of key insights and recommendations.
Strategic recommendations: Offering precise strategic recommendations aimed at enhancing the containment of COVID-19 spread, rooted in the analyzed data.
Feedback and adjustment: Soliciting feedback from stakeholders and making necessary adjustments to the strategy based on their input and reactions to proposed recommendations.
